# calculator

A  Flutter project.

In this project math expressions package is implemented for calculation.Here we have two display container one for the expression that  display what is pressed for calculation and next for the result. This project use a simple logic of if-else if statement in setstate() for the appropriate result( for eg: if we press AC then it will clear the display container and set all variable to zero i.e equation and result displaying container will show '0' on screen).Here % perform modulo operation not percentage operation.
